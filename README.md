Here is a little plugin for changing several text layers at once.

Here is how it works:
1. Select several layers
2. Hit cmd+shift+k (you can change shortcut in System Preferences)
3. Set new value and hit enter
4. Done!

• If all selected layers already have same value you can edit it from a placeholder.

• If you select group plugin would change *every* text layer in it.

• The plugin makes no effect on symbols.

• If you like to prevent some layer in a group from changing value make sure its name starting with the minus (' - '). The plugin would ignore such layers both when calculating placeholder value and changing values.
